# How to contribute

This repo is the final project of part 2 of 5 of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program] (https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). As per the exam's requirements this is an individual project, hence it won't be open for contributions until it is submitted to the mentors for the review and approved. I'll edit this file once I'm allowed to accept external contributions.
