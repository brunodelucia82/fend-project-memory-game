## Instructions

To start playing open the index.html file.

You'll see 16 cards on the table. Each card has a symbol. For each card there's another identical card on the table, i.e. there are 8 pairs of cards on the table. At the beginning of the game all cards will lay face-down on the table. Click any card to turn it over. Turn over cards two at a time, if the two cards match each other they will stay face-up on the table and change color, otherwise they'll automatically be turned face down after one second.

On the top of the page there is a timer, a moves counter, a star rating and a restart button. The timer will automatically start as soon as the first card is clicked and will only stop once all the 16 cards have been turned face-up. The initial star rating is 3, you will lose one star every 10 attempts but the rating will never go below 1 star. You can abort the game and start a new one any time by clicking the restart button, i.e. the icon with the circular arrow on the top right corner.

The game finishes once all of the 8 pairs of cards have been successfully revealed. You'll be shown a congratulations message with your results.
